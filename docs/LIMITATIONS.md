# SynapseDB: System Limitations and Tradeoffs

This document outlines the current limitations of SynapseDB compared to production-grade distributed databases like CockroachDB, and explains the architectural tradeoffs made in this PostgreSQL-based implementation.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Consensus and Consistency

#### Limitation: No True Raft Consensus
**Current State**: Uses a simplified quorum-based voting system for writes
**Issue**: 
- Not Byzantine fault tolerant
- Potential for split-brain scenarios during network partitions
- No guaranteed linearizable consistency

**Impact**: 
- May allow inconsistent reads during failures
- Cannot guarantee strong consistency under all partition scenarios
- Manual intervention may be required for certain failure modes

**Production Solution**: Implement proper Raft consensus algorithm with:
- Leader election
- Log replication with term numbers
- Committed entry acknowledgments
- Byzantine fault tolerance

### 2. Schema Evolution

#### Limitation: DDL Replication via Event Triggers
**Current State**: Schema changes captured and replayed via event triggers
**Issues**:
- Race conditions during concurrent schema changes
- No schema versioning or migration coordination
- Potential for schema drift between nodes
- Limited rollback capabilities

**Impact**:
- Schema changes may fail on some nodes
- Inconsistent table structures possible
- Complex schema changes may break replication

**Production Solution**:
- Schema leases and coordinated migrations
- Version-controlled schema evolution
- Atomic schema changes across cluster
- Better conflict detection and resolution

### 3. Transaction Isolation

#### Limitation: Limited Distributed Transaction Support
**Current State**: Basic 2-phase commit for quorum writes
**Issues**:
- No distributed SERIALIZABLE isolation
- Cross-node transactions not fully ACID compliant
- Potential for phantom reads across nodes
- Limited deadlock detection across cluster

**Impact**:
- Applications may observe inconsistent state
- Complex transactions may fail unexpectedly
- Not suitable for financial or critical applications requiring strong consistency

**Production Solution**:
- Distributed transaction coordinator
- Cross-node snapshot isolation
- Global transaction ordering
- Distributed deadlock detection

### 4. Data Partitioning

#### Limitation: No Automatic Sharding
**Current State**: All data replicated to all nodes
**Issues**:
- Does not scale beyond a few nodes
- Storage and memory requirements grow linearly
- Query performance degrades with data size
- No automatic load distribution

**Impact**:
- Limited horizontal scalability
- Higher resource consumption
- Poor performance on large datasets
- Manual partitioning required for large tables

**Production Solution**:
- Range-based or hash-based sharding
- Automatic data placement and rebalancing
- Distributed query execution
- Partition-aware query routing

### 5. Network Partition Handling

#### Limitation: Basic Split-Brain Protection
**Current State**: Simple quorum checks, no sophisticated partition handling
**Issues**:
- May not handle complex network partitions gracefully
- Limited availability during partitions
- No automatic partition detection and healing
- Potential data loss in minority partitions

**Impact**:
- Service unavailability during network issues
- Manual intervention required for complex failures
- Risk of data inconsistency
- Limited fault tolerance

**Production Solution**:
- Advanced partition detection algorithms
- Automatic partition healing
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Better availability during partitions

### 6. Vector Operations

#### Limitation: Basic Vector Support
**Current State**: JSON-based vector operations, limited pgvector integration
**Issues**:

- Automatic vector index replication

### 7. Monitoring and Observability

#### Limitation: Basic Monitoring
**Current State**: Simple metrics and health checks
**Issues**:
- Limited distributed tracing
- Basic performance metrics
- No advanced anomaly detection
- Limited debugging tools

**Impact**:
- Difficult to troubleshoot complex issues
- Limited performance optimization insights
- Poor operational visibility
- Manual performance tuning required

**Production Solution**:
- Comprehensive distributed tracing
- Advanced metrics and alerting
- Performance analysis tools

- Schema flexibility between nodes
- Cross-version compatibility
- Row-level filtering

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher overhead than physical replication
- More complex conflict resolution
- Limited to supported data types
- Potential for replication lag

### 3. Event Triggers vs. Built-in DDL Coordination

#### Chosen: Event Triggers for DDL
**Advantages**:
- Works with existing PostgreSQL
- Captures all DDL changes
- Flexible implementation

**Disadvantages**:
- Race conditions possible
- Limited rollback capabilities
- Complex error handling
- Potential for inconsistencies

### 4. Simplified Consensus vs. Full Raft

#### Chosen: Simplified Quorum System
**Advantages**:
- Easier to implement and understand
- Lower complexity
- Sufficient for many use cases

**Disadvantages**:
- Not Byzantine fault tolerant
- Potential split-brain scenarios
- Less robust than Raft
- Limited partition tolerance

## Conclusion

SynapseDB represents a pragmatic approach to distributed PostgreSQL, balancing implementation complexity with functionality. While it has significant limitations compared to production-grade distributed databases, it provides valuable insights into distributed system design and serves as an excellent foundation for understanding these concepts.

For production use cases requiring strong consistency, high availability, and massive scale, consider mature solutions like CockroachDB, Google Spanner, or Amazon Aurora. However, for development, testing, and moderate-scale applications, SynapseDB offers a compelling PostgreSQL-native distributed database solution.

The limitations outlined here also serve as a roadmap for future improvements and highlight the engineering challenges involved in building production-grade distributed databases.
